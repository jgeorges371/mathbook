You'll find them in Algebra, the Physical Sciences, Biology, Chemistry and Engineering.\n\nIn its simplest form, an expression is a combination of operators and terms. They come in all different forms and variations, and their main purpose is to help us represent some mathematical model or biological/physical system. This tutorial will go over how to evaluate them and more.",
